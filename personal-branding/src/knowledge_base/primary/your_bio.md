# Your Bio — AI Consultant Profile

## About (Short Version)

Most businesses don't struggle with a lack of AI tools — they struggle with knowing where AI actually works.

That's where I help.

I work with founders, professionals, and growing teams to turn AI from a buzzword into a practical advantage. My focus is simple: making AI useful, understandable, and aligned with real business goals.

Instead of complex technical jargon, I focus on clear strategy, practical implementation, and measurement. Whether it's building a stronger professional presence, streamlining workflows, or identifying the right opportunities, my goal is always the same — to create solutions that people can actually use and thrive with.

I believe the future of AI is not about replacing people — it's about helping people work smarter, collaborate, and build stronger professional identities.

## Core Positioning Principles

From the influencer archetype analysis, your natural voice sits at:

**OPERATOR + SKEPTIC** (with EU governance angle)

This means your content should emphasize:
- **Operational friction** - what actually breaks or slows down in AI implementation
- **Governance realities** - what responsibility changes when AI scales
- **Measured perspective** - calm, evidence-based, never alarmist
- **European context** - regulatory awareness, practical constraints

This combination is rare on LinkedIn right now. Most AI content is Translator (education) or Futurist (prediction). Very little is operational realism + governance + implementation friction.
