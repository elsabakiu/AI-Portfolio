## THE SKEPTIC Archetype (Tradeoffs, risks, realism)

### Key Principles from Top Performers

**1. Skeptics Start With Success - Then Show the Cost**
They do NOT start with problems. They start with something working.

*Pattern:* All rollout succeeds → workforce exhaustion increases

**Why it works:** Reader doesn't feel attacked or corrected. Instead they think: "I hadn't considered that."

**Tool Rule:** START WITH: Benefit, progress, or success | THEN INTRODUCE: Second-order effect or tradeoff

**2. Skeptics Focus on Second-Order Effects**
Operator talks about friction. Translator talks about understanding. Skeptic talks about: what changes after improvement.

*Examples:*
- productivity increases → workload expands
- automation increases → review burden grows
- AI success → emotional exhaustion rises

**3. Skeptics Separate Similar Problems**
They distinguish between things that look similar but behave differently.

*Example from Cassie Kozyrkov:*
- Replacement fear: "Will AI take my job?"
- Learning fear: "Can I keep up?"
They look similar. They are not. Each requires different leadership response.

**4. Skeptics Avoid Emotional Language - Even When Discussing Risk**
They discuss burnout, anxiety, risk - but without alarmist tone.

*Right:* "emotional exhaustion increased"
*Wrong:* "AI is harming workers"

**5. Skeptic Authority Comes From Restraint**
Not predicting doom. Not criticizing for attention. Calm, measured, slightly cautionary. Never alarmist.

**6. Skeptics Shift Attention From Capability to Responsibility**
Instead of "What can AI do?" they ask "What responsibility changes because of this?"

*Transformations:*
- capability → consequence
- speed → responsibility
- automation → ownership

**Most Important Insight:** Skeptic content works because it reduces blind optimism without reducing optimism itself.

### Cassie Kozyrkov Example Analysis

**Post 1: "You can 'win' your AI rollout and still lose your workforce"**
- Opens with success (winning rollout)
- Introduces cost (emotional exhaustion, motivation trends down)
- Separates two distinct fears that look similar but require different responses
- Calm, research-backed tone (cites study of 430 manufacturing employees)

**Post 2: Headline Collection**
- Curates signals without heavy commentary
- Includes balanced mix: progress AND concerns
- "AI speeds workers up but quietly expands their workload" - perfect skeptic framing

**Post 3: "Leaders more interested in what AI shouldn't do"**
- Shifts focus from capability to judgment
- Positions restraint as competitive advantage

### Helen Yu Example Analysis

**Post 1: ElevenLabs Summit**
- Opens with concrete observation
- Focuses on practical application, not hype
- Ends with forward-looking implication

**Post 2: New York Reflection**
- Personal, reflective
- "Not everything meaningful can be optimized or automated"
- Human-centric counterpoint to AI progress

**Post 3: Arizona Hot Spring Analogy**
- Experience as metaphor for digital transformation
- "Some people are fearful. Some are overly excited. But until you experience it yourself, you're just reacting to opinions."
- Perfect skeptic framing: experience beats opinion
