# Testimonials — What Clients Say

## Overview

Over 4+ years of AI consulting across finance, healthcare, and retail, I've had the privilege of helping organizations turn AI potential into practical results. Here's what clients have said about working with Catalyst-Intelligence.

---

## Finance Sector

> *"Carolina helped us navigate the complexity of AI adoption without the usual hype. She worked alongside our compliance team from day one, which made all the difference when we went through regulatory review. The customer support automation project delivered exactly what was promised — and we're now scaling it across three more departments."*
> 
> **— Chief Operating Officer, European Bank**

---

> *"What set this engagement apart was the focus on governance. Most consultants want to talk about technology. Carolina wanted to talk about risk frameworks, escalation paths, and measurement. That's exactly what a regulated industry needs."*
> 
> **— Head of Compliance, Financial Services Firm**

---

## Healthcare Sector

> *"The no-show prediction project paid for itself in the first three months. But what impressed me most was how Carolina trained our team to understand and trust the model. Six months later, we're still using it — and we've expanded the approach to other areas."*
> 
> **— Operations Director, Regional Healthcare Provider**

---

> *"Finally, an AI consultant who speaks plain language. No jargon. No overpromising. Just clear thinking about what would actually work in our setting."*
> 
> **— Clinical Services Manager, Healthcare Organization**

---

## Retail & E-commerce

> *"Our supply chain team was skeptical about AI — they'd been burned by 'solutions' that didn't understand their workflow. Carolina spent time understanding how they actually worked before suggesting anything. The demand forecasting system we built together is now part of our weekly rhythm."*
> 
> **— Supply Chain Director, E-commerce Retailer**

---

> *"The results speak for themselves: 57% reduction in stockouts, 58% less excess inventory, and a team that actually knows how to use the tools. That last part matters most."*
> 
> **— CEO, Mid-sized Retailer**

---

## General Feedback

> *"Catalyst-Intelligence brought clarity to a space full of noise. Highly recommended for any organization wanting practical AI guidance."*
> 
> **— Founder, Tech Startup**

---

> *"What I appreciated most: Carolina doesn't try to sell you AI. She helps you figure out if AI even makes sense for your problem — and if not, she tells you. That kind of honesty is rare."*
> 
> **— Managing Director, Professional Services Firm**
