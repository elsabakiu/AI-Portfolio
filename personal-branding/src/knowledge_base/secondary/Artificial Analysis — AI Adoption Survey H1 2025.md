# Artificial Analysis — AI Adoption Survey H1 2025

## Comprehensive Summary

The Artificial Analysis AI Adoption Survey - H1 2025 is a data-driven report capturing real-world artificial intelligence adoption patterns during the first half of 2025. Conducted between April and June 2025, the survey draws on responses from over 1,000 professionals spanning engineers, executives, and other roles across a diverse set of industries and regions.

## 1. Survey Scope and Objectives

**Sample Characteristics:**
- Respondents: ~1,036 professionals (engineers, managers, executives)
- Geographic Spread: Multiple regions including North America, Europe, Asia
- Company Sizes: Small, medium, and enterprise respondents
- Survey Period: April-June 2025

## 2. Adoption Maturity - From Pilot to Production

A key signal in the results is that AI adoption is moving beyond isolated experiments toward operational use cases. Nearly half of surveyed organizations indicated they are now deploying AI in production workflows — a significant milestone that suggests AI is increasingly embedded in routine business processes.

Organizations are no longer just "trying out" AI; they are operationalizing it — using it for dashboards, real-time analytics, automation tasks, customer support, internal knowledge workflows, and decision support.

## 3. Multi-Model and Multi-Vendor Adoption

On average, organizations reported exploring nearly **4.7 different model families** simultaneously — indicating that most teams are pursuing a hybrid model strategy rather than relying on a single AI provider.

This multi-model strategy reflects:
- **Functional differentiation**: Different models are better suited for distinct tasks
- **Risk diversification**: Teams hedge against vendor lock-in
- **Optimization for cost and quality**: Organizations balance cost-effectiveness with output quality

## 4. Language Model Landscape & Preferences

Leading proprietary models — including versions of OpenAI's models, xAI Grok, and Google Gemini — continue to dominate enterprise usage. Open weights and open-source models are narrowing the performance gap, but proprietary offerings still hold strong positions in many production use cases.

## 5. Use Cases & Functional Deployment

Adopters are integrating AI into a variety of functional areas, including:
- Production and real-time workflows
- Dashboarding and analytics
- Knowledge retrieval and collaboration
- Automation of routine tasks
- Coding and developmental assistance

Cross-functional initiatives involving business, product, and customer success groups are increasingly incorporating AI capabilities.

## 6. Enterprise Trends and Strategic Direction

### A. AI as a Strategic Tool
AI is considered essential for competitive differentiation and operational efficiency in 2025.

### B. Pilot-to-Production Transition
Nearly half of respondents report moving AI into production, increasing expectations around governance, monitoring, and lifecycle management.

### C. Diversified Model Engagement
Average engagement with multiple AI model families shows organizations seek best-fit AI solutions rather than one-size-fits-all platforms.

## 7. Strategic Implications for Leaders & Content

Key takeaways:
- AI adoption is crossing the Rubicon from pilot to operational use
- Diversified model strategies are now the de-facto norm
- Functional adoption is broadening beyond core analytics teams
- Business leaders should benchmark their own adoption levels against sector trends
