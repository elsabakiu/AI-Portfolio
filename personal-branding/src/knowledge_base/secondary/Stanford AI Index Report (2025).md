- **Generative AI dominates funding flows**—driven by new business models, API commercialization, enterprise demand
- **China remains strong contender**—particularly in computer vision, autonomous systems, LLMs tailored to local markets

AI no longer niche technology spending—core business and strategic infrastructure investment in mature and emerging markets.

## 2. Research & Technical Progress

Tracks academic and corporate research output:
- Publication counts in top conferences/journals
- Citation impact
- Open-sourced model releases
- Benchmark performance

**Key insights:**
- Research productivity remains high across U.S., China, Europe
- Growing contributions from emerging markets and cross-institution collaborations
- Performance on benchmarks—language understanding, image recognition, multimodal reasoning—continues rapid improvement

AI technical capability advancing at accelerated pace, laying foundation for broader adoption.

## 3. Model Development & Commercialization

Trends in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI:
- Model size, compute scales, capability metrics increasing—in research and commercial deployments
- **Multi-modal models** (processing text, images, other formats) gaining traction—enabling richer applications in creative, analytical, decision support
- Commercial cloud providers packaging models into enterprise APIs—democratizing access

Model capability quickly commoditized—competitive advantage shifting toward integration, workflow adaptation, proprietary data advantages.

## 4. Adoption and Deployment Trends

Data on how organizations use AI across sectors:
- Experimentation nearly universal in large firms
- Adoption patterns vary widely: tech, finance, digital services leading
- Many traditional industries (manufacturing, healthcare, retail) in early stages—limited to discrete use cases

Depth of integration—extent AI alters core business workflows—remains uneven.

## 5. Workforce and Skills Dynamics

Labor market dynamics related to AI:
- AI-related job postings and talent mobility increasing across sectors
- Growing demand for technical and non-technical AI skills
- Employers value: technical expertise AND domain knowledge combined with AI literacy
- Geographic shifts in talent hubs as remote work and distributed AI teams become common

Human capital—not just models—central factor in competitive advantage.

## 6. Geopolitical & Competitive Landscape

- **United States:** leadership in research output, model production, private investment
- **China:** rapidly growing in research contribution and commercial AI deployments
- **Europe:** lags in private investment but advances in governance frameworks and ethical AI standards

National strategies, funding ecosystems, regulatory environments shape competitive landscape.

## 7. Policy & Governance Themes

Policy progress in major regions:
- **EU:** increased attention to AI ethics, safety, regulation—risk-based controls
- **U.S.:** innovation-centric approach balancing growth incentives with risk mitigation
- **Emerging economies:** developing AI strategies emphasizing capacity building and workforce training

Regulatory environments maturing alongside technology—creating opportunities and challenges.
