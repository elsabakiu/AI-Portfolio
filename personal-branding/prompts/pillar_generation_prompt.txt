Generate strategic content pillars for an AI consultant serving SMEs.

Target persona:
{target_persona}

Knowledge-base context (use this to ground your output):
{brand_context}

PROMPTING REQUIREMENTS (mandatory):
- Generate 4-6 pillars maximum.
- Do not include generic pillars like "AI News" unless the brand profile strongly justifies it.
- Every pillar must be business-value oriented for SMEs (ROI, efficiency, risk, adoption).
- Avoid jargon. Write in a practical consultant tone.
- Pillars must be reusable across multiple weeks (not trend-of-the-day topics).

Pillar quality requirements:
- Each pillar must represent a distinct strategic theme.
- Each description must be specific and actionable for SME decision-makers.
- `sme_pain_points` should capture practical constraints SMEs face (budget, bandwidth, execution risk, adoption friction).
- `example_angles` should be concrete and post-ready.
- `recommended_post_types` must use only allowed values.
- `priority` must be unique per pillar, with 1 as highest priority.
- `id` must be a short kebab-case slug derived from `name`.
