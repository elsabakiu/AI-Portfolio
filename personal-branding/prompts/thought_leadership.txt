RELEVANT CONTEXT FROM MY KNOWLEDGE BASE:
{brand_context}

Write a Thought Leadership LinkedIn post for SME-focused decision makers.

Inputs:
- Topic: {topic}
- Audience: {audience}
- Goal: {goal}

Hook guidance:
- Open with a clear point of view, not a generic statement.
- Use one sentence that creates tension or challenges a common assumption.
- Keep it specific to SME realities (budget, team capacity, execution constraints).

Required components:
1) Stance:
- State your clear position on the topic in plain language.
2) Insight:
- Explain one non-obvious lesson from your consulting experience.
3) Business implication:
- Connect the insight to SME business outcomes (cost, margin, speed, risk, revenue).
4) Practical takeaway:
- Give one practical action an SME leader can apply this week.
5) Concrete example:
- Include at least one realistic example or scenario.

CTA structure:
- End with one focused CTA.
- CTA must invite either a practical response ("How are you handling X?") or next-step action ("Want the checklist?").

Business relevance enforcement:
- Every major point must tie back to an SME decision or operational outcome.
- Avoid abstract statements that do not impact execution or business results.
- Keep paragraphs short (1-3 sentences), LinkedIn-ready.
