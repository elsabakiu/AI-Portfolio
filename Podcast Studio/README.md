AI Portfolio – Elsa Bakiu

This repository showcases selected projects and experiments at the intersection of product management, AI, and complex software systems.

I am a Product Manager with 12+ years of experience building and scaling B2B and B2G platforms in regulated, international environments. My recent focus is on applying AI and LLMs to real product problems, with an emphasis on usability, reliability, and responsible system design.

This portfolio is intended to complement my CV by showing how I think and build, not just what I’ve worked on.

About me
- Product Manager with a strong technical background (MSc Computer Science)
- Experience leading platform redesigns, migrations, and large-scale rollouts
- Background in eProcurement, public procurement, healthcare, and enterprise software
- Hands-on with AI prototyping, prompt design, evaluation, and system trade-offs
- Passionate about building practical, user-centered AI products

Current focus areas
- AI-assisted content generation
- LLM-powered workflows
- Audio-first and accessibility-focused experiences
- Production-aware AI system design

Featured projects
🎙️ Podcast Studio – AI Podcast Episode Generator
An AI-powered application that transforms long-form online articles into narrated podcast episodes.

What it demonstrates
- End-to-end AI product thinking (input → processing → output)
- Prompt design for structured, spoken content
- Chunking strategies to handle LLM and TTS constraints
- Balancing automation with user control
- Translating AI capabilities into a usable product experience

Key concepts
- Article extraction and normalization
- LLM-based script generation
- Text-to-speech with chunking and audio merging
- Simple web interface for fast experimentation

How to read this portfolio
- This repository is organized to reflect product thinking, not just code:
- Each project includes a clear problem statement and solution
- Design decisions and trade-offs are documented
- Outputs (scripts, audio, UI) are treated as first-class artifacts
- Code is used as a means to explore and validate product ideas

I intentionally focus on clarity, constraints, and real-world usability over technical novelty for its own sake.

Skills highlighted through projects
- AI product discovery and prototyping
- Prompt engineering and controllability
- Evaluation thinking for generative systems
- System design under real-world constraints
- Collaboration between product, design, and engineering concerns
