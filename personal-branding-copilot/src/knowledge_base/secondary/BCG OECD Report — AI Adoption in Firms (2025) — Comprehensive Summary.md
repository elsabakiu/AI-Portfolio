# BCG OECD Report — AI Adoption in Firms (2025) — Comprehensive Summary

## Executive Summary

**Title:** The Adoption of Artificial Intelligence in Firms  
**Focus:** Enterprise adoption barriers, policy enablers, productivity implications

### Overview
- This OECD/BCG/INSEAD collaboration examines AI adoption across G7 countries and Brazil, combining firm-level surveys and interviews
- Highlights both the potential for AI to improve productivity and the policy and organisational barriers that still slow adoption

### Key Findings
- AI adoption is increasing, but barriers such as skills gaps, infrastructure limitations, and policy clarity remain
- Public policy, education and training are crucial to accelerate AI uptake, especially among SMEs and lagging industries
- Emphasises need for internationally comparable data and better measurement of workflow-level AI integration

### Strategic Insights
- Policy frameworks must support both technology diffusion and workforce readiness to translate AI investments into productivity gains
- Collaboration between public and private sectors increases likelihood of successful adoption

## Detailed Summary

The BCG/OECD AI Adoption in Firms report is a joint, data-driven analysis exploring how businesses worldwide are adopting artificial intelligence, where adoption is thriving, barriers that persist, and conditions that enable meaningful value creation. The report combines firm-level data, economic modeling, and organizational case studies to offer a holistic perspective on adoption patterns, productivity effects, and structural enablers.

## 1. Adoption Landscape — What the Data Shows

The report confirms AI adoption is increasing across firms of all sizes but highlights significant variation:

- Large firms adopt AI at much higher rates than SMEs due to greater financial resources, in-house expertise, and existing digital infrastructure
- Adoption concentrated in digitally mature sectors (technology, finance, e-commerce) while traditional sectors (manufacturing, retail, logistics) show uneven uptake
- Many adopters remain in pilot or limited-scope phases—AI tools used in isolation rather than integrated into core workflows

## 2. Barriers to Adoption — What's Holding Firms Back

### a) Skills Shortages
Persistent gap between AI-related skills needed and talent available across:
- Technical skills (data science, ML engineering)
- Operational skills (AI project management, use-case definition)
- Strategic skills (value mapping, governance)

### b) Data Readiness Issues
Many firms struggle with:
- Siloed or unstructured data
- Inconsistent data governance practices
- Lack of shared access between business units

### c) Financial Risk and Cost Perception
Perceived risk remains high despite declining costs:
- Uncertainty about ROI
- Fear of wasted spend
- No clear measurement frameworks

### d) Organizational Culture and Change Management
Firms with strong change management practices and adaptive cultures are more likely to adopt and scale AI successfully.

## 3. Productivity Effects — When AI Works

Firms adopting AI strategically and integrating into workflows show measurable gains in:
- Customer support automation
- Predictive maintenance
- Supply chain optimization
- Business analytics and reporting

Productivity increases when AI combines with process redesign, governance, and performance measurement—not automation alone but amplification.

## 4. Role of Complementary Investments

Essential complementary investments include:
- Workforce training and skill development
- Process redesign and workflow integration
- IT infrastructure and scalable architectures
- Governance and ethics frameworks

Firms combining technology investment with these components consistently outperform those adopting AI in isolation.

## 5. Policy, Ecosystems, and Public-Private Interactions

Public policy enables adoption through:
- Workforce development and reskilling programs
- Data governance standards
- SME support initiatives
- Research and training subsidies

Collaboration between firms, universities, and public institutions increases diffusion of best practices.

## 6. Strategic Implications for Business Leaders

1. Focus on capabilities before tooling
2. Redesign processes before automating them
3. Measure before scaling—tie AI to specific KPIs
4. Invest in skills across the organization
5. Engage with ecosystems and policy frameworks

## 7. Case Patterns — Real Organizational Outcomes

- Early adopters with governance and metrics scale AI enterprise-wide
- SMEs partnering with external consultants overcome talent barriers faster
- Firms with adaptive cultures accelerate through experimentation

## 8. Sector Variability

- Leaders: Finance, tech, insurance, digital services
- Hybrid adopters: Manufacturing, healthcare, logistics (strong in discrete use cases, weaker cross-organizationally)

## 9. Long-Term Impact — Compounding Advantage

Organizations integrating AI early build cumulative capabilities that accelerate subsequent adoption; delays create widening adoption gaps.

## Conclusion

AI adoption is widespread but value capture uneven. Barriers—skills gaps, data readiness, organizational culture—matter more than tools. Complementary investments differentiate success from stagnation. Strategic alignment, capability building, and governance are as critical as the AI models themselves.
