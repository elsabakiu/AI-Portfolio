# Wharton Human-AI Research & GBK Collective 2025 AI Adoption Report — Comprehensive Summary

**Title:** Accountable Acceleration: Gen AI Fast-Tracks Into the Enterprise  
**Focus:** Enterprise AI adoption patterns, ROI measurement, organizational readiness

## 1. Scope and Methodology

- Survey of **800+ senior decision-makers** in U.S. enterprises (≥1,000 employees, >$550M revenue)
- Conducted mid-2025
- Respondents from: IT, HR, Operations, Sales & Marketing, Legal, Finance, Product/Engineering
- Tracks adoption patterns over three years—usage frequency, investment focus, ROI measurement, organizational readiness

## 2. Core Findings — Three Major Themes

### A. Everyday AI — Adoption Is Mainstream

AI usage moved beyond early pilots and isolated experiments:

- **82% of enterprise leaders** report using Gen AI weekly—up significantly
- **46% now report daily usage**—year-over-year increase of ~17 percentage points
- Familiarity deepened across non-technical functions (legal, HR, marketing) in addition to traditional adopters (IT, procurement)
- Use concentrated in practical, repeatable tasks: data analysis, research summarization, content creation, workflow automation

Generative AI gone from novelty to normal in enterprise workflows.

### B. Proving Value — Measurement and ROI

Major shift: organizations increasingly measuring outcomes and tying usage to business value:

- **72% of organizations now formally track Gen AI ROI** through productivity, profitability, operational metrics
- **~3 in 4 enterprises report positive returns** on Gen AI investments
- Majority expect AI investments to pay off within 2–3 years and plan increased budget commitments
- **88% anticipate increasing AI budgets** in next year
- **62% expect double-digit growth** in AI investment over next 2–5 years
- ~1/3 of AI technology budgets allocated to internal R&D—enterprises investing in custom capabilities beyond off-the-shelf tools

Transition from pilot-centric usage to accountable, measured deployment reflects maturing landscape where executive teams demand clear outcomes.

### C. The Human Capital Lever — People and Processes Matter Most

Largest obstacles are organizational and human, not technological:

- Leadership engagement strengthened—more organizations creating dedicated AI leadership roles (Chief AI Officers)
- Training budgets and workforce readiness remain inconsistent—gaps in skill development and confidence
- **Trust, governance, employee capability decisive factors** for sustained success—even more than technology access
- Concern: increased AI usage may reduce certain skill proficiencies if workers become overly dependent—highlighting need for balanced training enhancing rather than supplanting human capability

Organizational readiness and culture as important to AI success as tools and infrastructure.

## 3. Sector and Functional Adoption Variability

- **IT, Procurement, Legal:** higher confidence and frequency—often leading early adoption
- **Marketing, Sales, Operations:** catching up, embedding AI in routine workstreams
- **Tech/Telecom, Professional Services, Banking/Finance:** faster adoption than manufacturing and retail—though all trending upward

Adoption maturity correlates with function and strategic urgency within different parts of organization.

## 4. Strategic Implications & Outlook

**A. AI Is Now an Operational Norm**
Gen AI use no longer confined to labs or POCs—part of daily workflows across enterprise functions

**B. Value Measurement Is Now Standard**
Formal ROI measurement moved from "nice-to-have" to expected discipline—emphasizing productivity and profit impact

**C. Talent and Culture Are the New Frontier**
Leadership alignment, skills upgrading, trust building, governance frameworks central to AI scaling—turning people and process design into competitive differentiators

**D. Investment Confidence Is High**
Strong budget growth expectations and R&D commitments signal enterprises strategically institutionalizing AI capabilities
