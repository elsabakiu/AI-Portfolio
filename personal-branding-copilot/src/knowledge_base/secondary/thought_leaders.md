# Thought Leaders & Influencers in AI

## Influencer Archetype Framework

Based on analysis of top LinkedIn AI voices, influencers fall into five distinct archetypes:

### 1. THE OPERATOR (Implementation, execution, "what works in reality")
*Followed for AI deployment, not theory*

**Key Names:**
- Pascal Bornet - Intelligent automation & enterprise AI implementation
- Menno Fokkema - AI strategy & implementation focus (EU-heavy audience)
- Vin Vashishta - Applied AI strategy and operational reality
- Amit Rawal - Practical AI transformation content

**Why they matter:** Posts grounded in execution; strong SME and enterprise appeal; high consulting conversion rate

**Typical content pattern:** "What breaks after AI goes live."

### 2. THE TRANSLATOR (Making AI understandable for business audiences)
*Often the largest LinkedIn AI followings - they reduce complexity*

**Key Names:**
- Andrew Ng - AI education & applied AI framing
- Allie K. Miller - AI business strategy and ROI communication
- Ethan Mollick - AI & future-of-work explanations for business leaders
- Kate Strachnyi - Data storytelling and AI accessibility

**Why they matter:** Translate technical capability into business meaning; huge reach among non-technical executives

**Typical content pattern:** "What AI actually changes in your daily work."

### 3. THE SKEPTIC (Tradeoffs, risks, realism)
*Gain authority by not overselling AI*

**Key Names:**
- Cassie Kozyrkov - Decision intelligence & responsible AI
- Gary Marcus - AI limitations & critique
- Helen Yu - Responsible AI & enterprise governance

**Why they matter:** High trust audiences; strong enterprise credibility; appeal to risk-sensitive organizations

**Typical content pattern:** "What gets harder after AI adoption."

### 4. THE BUILDER (Experimentations, learning by building)
*Followed by technical and product audiences*

**Key Names:**
- Andrej Karpathy - Engineering insight and iterative learning
- Lex Fridman - Technical exploration and AI discussions
- Daniel Hulme - Applied AI and systems thinking

**Why they matter:** Authority from experimentation; strong credibility with builders and founders

**Typical content pattern:** "Here's what we learned after building this."

### 5. THE FUTURIST (Patterns, direction, where AI is going)
*Dominate high-level strategy discussions*

**Key Names:**
- Bernard Marr - AI & business trends
- Reid Hoffman - AI future and economic impact
- Demis Hassabis - AI trajectory and research direction

**Why they matter:** Large reach; influence executives and investors

**Typical content pattern:** "The next phase of AI will change..."

## Important Insight
Top LinkedIn AI consultants rarely stay in one archetype, but their audience knows them for ONE dominant perspective.

| Person | Dominant Archetype |
|--------|-------------------|
| Andrew Ng | Translator |
| Cassie Kozyrkov | Skeptic |
| Allie Miller | Translator / Operator hybrid |
| Bernard Marr | Futurist |
| Pascal Bornet | Operator |

## Strategic Note for Positioning
Based on your content and EU governance angle, you naturally sit at: **Operator + Skeptic** - which is rare on LinkedIn right now. Most AI content is Translator (education) or Futurist (prediction). Very little is operational realism + governance + implementation friction.
