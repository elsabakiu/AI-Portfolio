# Content Examples by Archetype

## THE TRANSLATOR Archetype (Making AI understandable)

### Key Principles from Top Performers

**1. Translators Start With Context, Not Opinion**
Translator posts rarely start with opinions/conclusions. They start with a situation, environment, or group experiencing change.

*Example from Andrew Ng:*
"I spoke at Sundance and many people in Hollywood are uncomfortable with AI..."

**Tool Rule:** OPEN WITH: Context or environment | NOT: Insight or conclusion

**2. Translators Reduce Fear by Explaining Mechanisms**
They explain WHY something feels the way it does.

*Pattern:* Misunderstanding → underlying mechanism
- "AI replaces jobs" → hiring dynamics explanation
- "AI is dangerous" → incentive explanation

**3. Translators Normalize Complexity**
They don't dramatize change - they normalize it by comparing to previous tech waves, gradual shifts instead of disruption narratives.

**4. Translators Separate Signal From Noise**
They acknowledge hype, then narrow the scope.

*Pattern:* Common narrative → Narrower reality

**5. Translators Explain Without Teaching**
Posts feel explanatory but not educational because they:
- Assume intelligent readers
- Avoid step-by-step explanation
- Don't define basic terms

**6. Translator Authority Comes From Calmness**
Calm tone, lack of urgency, balanced framing. No "act now" or "companies must" language.

**7. Translators Use Examples as Bridges**
Industries, roles, real scenarios allow readers to map insight onto their own context.

**Most Important Insight:** Translator content works because it lowers cognitive effort. Readers feel smarter after reading, not instructed.

- Personal observation: 80% manual → 20% agents (Nov) to 20% manual → 80% agents (Dec)
- Makes abstract trend tangible through personal experience
- "Programming in English now" - memorable framing

**Post 3: Agent Team / Boardroom Concept**
