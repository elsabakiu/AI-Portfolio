# Case Studies — AI Transformation Projects

## Overview

Over the past 4 years at Ironhack, I've delivered 10+ AI transformation projects across finance, healthcare, and retail. Each project focused on turning AI potential into measurable business value through practical implementation, workflow integration, and responsible governance.

Below are three representative case studies that illustrate my approach.

## Case Study 1: Financial Services — Automated Customer Support & Risk Triage

**Industry:** Finance  
**Project Duration:** 6 months  
**Team Size:** Cross-functional (IT, Compliance, Customer Operations)

### The Challenge
A mid-sized European bank was struggling with high volumes of routine customer inquiries, leading to long response times and frustrated customers. At the same time, compliance teams were overwhelmed with manual triage of potential fraud cases. The bank needed a solution that could both improve customer experience and strengthen risk management — without compromising regulatory requirements.

### The Approach
Rather than jumping to tool selection, we started with:
- **Discovery:** Mapped 6 months of customer inquiry data to identify patterns and high-volume categories
- **Governance-first design:** Worked with compliance from day one to ensure regulatory alignment (GDPR, banking regulations)
- **Phased implementation:** 
  1. Automated tier-1 customer inquiries (balance checks, transaction history)
  2. Added intelligent routing for complex cases
  3. Integrated fraud detection triage into the same workflow

### Key Interventions
- Deployed NLP-powered chatbot for common inquiries (40% reduction in ticket volume)
- Built ML-based fraud triage system that prioritized high-risk cases for human review
- Established human-in-the-loop escalation paths for edge cases
- Created measurement framework tracking: response time, resolution rate, fraud detection accuracy

### The Results
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Average response time | 48 hours | 4 hours | 92% faster |
| Tier-1 inquiry resolution | 30% automated | 85% automated | +55% |
| Fraud case triage time | 3 days | 4 hours | 87% faster |
| Compliance review burden | 100% manual | 60% automated | 40% reduction |

### Key Takeaway
Success came from **governance-first design**, not technology alone. By involving compliance early and designing clear escalation paths, we built a system that was both efficient and regulator-ready.

## Case Study 2: Healthcare — Predictive Analytics for Patient No-Shows

**Industry:** Healthcare  
**Project Duration:** 4 months  
**Team Size:** Small (Operations, Data, Clinical Staff)

### The Challenge
A regional healthcare provider was losing approximately €2.5M annually due to patient no-shows. Appointment gaps meant wasted staff time and delayed care for other patients. Traditional reminder calls were time-intensive and only marginally effective.

### The Approach
We focused on a narrow, measurable use case rather than broad AI transformation:
- **Data integration:** Combined historical appointment data with demographic, weather, and public holiday data
- **Predictive modeling:** Built a model to identify patients with high no-show probability
- **Intervention design:** Created tiered intervention strategies based on risk level
- **Workflow integration:** Embedded predictions into existing scheduling system — no new tools, just smarter workflows

### Key Interventions
- Developed no-show probability scores for all scheduled appointments
- Created automated workflow for high-risk patients: confirmation call + SMS reminder + easy rescheduling link
- Built dashboard for staff to monitor same-day high-risk appointments
- Established continuous learning loop: model retrained monthly with new data

### The Results
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| No-show rate | 18% | 11% | 39% reduction |
| Annual savings | — | €975,000 | — |
| Staff time on reminders | 20 hrs/week | 8 hrs/week | 60% reduction |
| Patient satisfaction | 3.8/5 | 4.3/5 | +13% |

### Key Takeaway
**Narrow use cases with clear metrics** often deliver faster ROI than ambitious transformation programs. This project paid for itself in the first 3 months.

## Case Study 3: Retail — Supply Chain Optimization & Demand Forecasting

**Industry:** Retail (Mid-sized e-commerce)  
**Project Duration:** 8 months  
**Team Size:** Cross-functional (Supply Chain, Marketing, IT, Finance)

### The Challenge
A growing e-commerce retailer was facing inventory inefficiencies: stockouts on popular items and overstock on slow-moving products. The supply chain team relied on spreadsheets and intuition, leading to missed revenue opportunities and high warehousing costs.

### The Approach
We treated this as an **organizational redesign**, not just a technical implementation:
- **Process mapping:** Documented end-to-end supply chain decisions and handoffs
- **Capability assessment:** Identified skill gaps in data literacy across the supply chain team
- **Model development:** Built demand forecasting models using historical sales, marketing calendar, and seasonal data
- **Change management:** Trained supply chain team to interpret forecasts and adjust ordering

### Key Interventions
- Deployed ML-based demand forecasting with 4-week rolling predictions
- Created automated reorder recommendations based on forecast + lead time
- Built visualization dashboard for supply chain team (no coding required)
- Established weekly forecast review meeting to build team confidence with AI recommendations
- Integrated marketing promotion calendar into forecast model

### The Results
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Stockout rate | 14% | 6% | 57% reduction |
| Excess inventory | €1.2M | €0.5M | 58% reduction |
| Forecast accuracy | 68% | 89% | +21% |
| Order fulfillment time | 3.5 days | 2.1 days | 40% faster |
| Annual savings | — | €840,000 | — |

### Key Takeaway
**Complementary investments in training and process redesign** mattered more than the model itself. The team's ability to trust and act on AI recommendations was the real differentiator.

## Common Themes Across All Case Studies

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Start with the problem, not the tool** | Every project began with a clear business problem and measurable outcomes |
| **Governance is not an afterthought** | Compliance and risk frameworks built from day one enabled faster scaling |
| **Workflow integration > tool adoption** | Success came from embedding AI into existing workflows, not adding new tools |
| **People matter most** | Training, change management, and capability building determined long-term success |
| **Measure early and often** | Clear KPIs tied to business outcomes enabled rapid iteration and stakeholder buy-in |

## What These Cases Reveal About My Approach

> **"AI without complementary investments is like buying a race car without fuel — the potential is there, but it cannot be realized."**

Across all three projects, the organizations that captured value weren't the ones with the most sophisticated models. They were the ones that:
- Invested in **workforce training**
- Redesigned **processes and workflows**
- Built **governance frameworks**
- Measured **outcomes, not just adoption**

This is the Catalyst-Intelligence approach: practical, measurable, and focused on where AI actually works.
